Ethical hacking is a socially accepted form of hacking that seeks to help, rather than hurt, the owners and users of a website or computer network. 
In fact, ethical hackers help businesses to be alert to the weaknesses in their security systems so that these can be improved.
As businesses use computers and virtual network to house tons and tons of business and customer data,it becomes a highly attractive target for hackers.
In this scenario, ethical hackers serve a very useful purpose by identifying weak spots in these systems that can make it vulnerable to unethical hackers.
This segrigates hackers into three catogeries :-
1. White hat hackers 
2. Grey hat hackers
3. Black hat hackers

## White Hat Hackers
These are the one which are also known as ethical hackers. They mostly work into protecting a special asset by live monitoring them and by conducting 
penetration test on them. 

## Grey Hat Hackers
They sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. 
The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company. 

## Black Hat Hackers
Closer to the definition that most people outside the IT world know and use, black hat hackers create programs and campaigns solely for causing damage. 
This may be anything from stealing information using malware to forcefully shutting down networks using denial-of-service attacks.

## Types Of Ethical Hackers

Ethical hackers understand all the techniques that malicious hackers use to penetrate a system or network. CEH certification training online offers access
to the knowledge and skills of ethical hacking. Thus, they use this knowledge to prevent such attacks on different parts of the system, mainly by:

 ~ Identifying vulnerabilities in web applications that can put at risk the security of not only business data, but all the data of thousands of app users.
 ~ Identifying loopholes in the security infrastructure of an IT network that can lead to theft of corporate data.
 ~ Making web servers secure against malicious hacking and attacks such as viruses and Trojan horses.
 ~ Minimizing the risk of data phishing and identity theft that takes place through wireless hotspots.
 ~ Preventing social engineering threats that can make individuals more vulnerable to online scams.

# Steps involved In Ethical Hacking

## 1. Information Gathering
## 2. Scanning and Enumeration 
## 3. Gaining access
## 4. Maintaining access
## 5. Analysis 
## 6. Clearing Traces
## 7. Preparing Report
